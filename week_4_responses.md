One example of hot media I experienced recently was going to see a film at the music box. Even more so because it was a 3D based documentary covering the artist Anselm Keiffer. This was a passive consumption of media as the visuals and audio initiated all of my senses throughout the film. I understand where McLuhan is coming from when referring to hot media though not to discredit movies as an art form and there are certainly aspects of any time based medium that could be considered cold media, but I digress. Narrative is a major aspect of what we consider hot and cold and when that narrative is not illustrated to you directly it can be powerful in how it forces you to use your own interpretation and discovery.  

I'm still attempting to understand fully the differences between hot and cold media, but I want to introduce another piece of media I find particularly fascinating and to be an example of cold media. 17776 is one of my favorite science fiction stories created by Jon Bois, it is a web based mixed media project published through a sports journalism article. As you scroll the entire site transforms from just a common article on football and becomes a fabric of time the viewer must piece through. You begin scrolling through many calnder days and read narration from talking satelleites. You start from the perspective of Pioneer 9 and follow many converstations it has with other sateillites that only have infinite time to kill drifting through space. This is all in a dystopian future where humans have figured out to live forever and in their realization that there is nothing left to search for they stay on earth and play various versions of football. These versions of football have fields that expand across entire borders and many different rules and territories are put in place by players. This I feel as an exmaple of cold media because the viewer must piece together this narrative through the non linear organization of each event and must interpret it their own way.
